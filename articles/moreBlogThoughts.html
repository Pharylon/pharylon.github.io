<h2>More Blog Thoughts</h2>
<div class="date">Nov 14, 2018</div>

<p>
  I'm going to set down a few ideas about what I want to accomplish with my as-yet-unnamed blogging framework. What
  are my goals and
  what do I hope to accomplish with it? Here are a few preliminary thoughts.
  <ul>
    <li>It uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so it should run forever.</li>
    <li>No build tools. The source is the site and the site is the source.</li>
    <li>It should be approachable for anyone that knows HTML.</li>
    <li>It should be easily understood and customizable to anyone that knows Javascript.</li>
    <li>No feature creep. It does the bare minimum of what a blog needs to do.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I suppose that covers it for now. I'm debating what my next thing should be. Maybe tags? Those seem like something
  most blogs have, but does that go against "feature creep" and "doing the bare minimum?". A mobile view would be 
  nice, though it looks pretty OK on phones already. Maybe RSS, but does anyone even use RSS anymore? ðŸ˜¢
</p>

<p>
  Am I already pretty much done?
