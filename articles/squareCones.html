<h2>Square Cones</h2>
<div class="date">Oct 6, 2019</div>



<p>
  Because this is how my mind works, I woke up with the whole "Square Cones" thing on my head this morning. I know y'all
  said
  we've been doing it this way, but in this post I'm going to put forward the argument that we haven't been doing that.
  Then
  I'm going to put forward the argument that's not how it works in 5e anyway, and then I'm going to blow your mind
  about 5e movement in general. ðŸ™‚
</p>

<p>
  So first, first let's talk about how we haven't been using the 5' diagonal rule in 5e. First, the most obvious
  argument is we've
  been using a spell template for cones which is decidedly not-square-shaped. Here's a a picture I took where I drew out
  a templated
  cone and put it next to a 4e spell template for cones.

<p>
  Now, you may be thinking, "that doesn't look so bad". That 4e cone template is a pretty good rough approximation
  of a cone. And you're right! It is! But that's not how we "should" be doing it if we county diagonals as one
  square for spells. If you look at the 4e template that 60' cone goes 12 squares on the sides and only 8 squares
  diagonally.
  Ruh-roh. So what does the cone look like if we drew it out with each diagonal counting as 5'? Like this:

<p>
  It's important to note that this is not, in fact, cone shaped. It's a square. This is a 60' square. Let me illustrate
  this further.
  This is a 20' radius fireball spell when we count diagonally 1:1.

<p>In contrast, below is a spell that is a 40' cube</p>

<p>And finally, this is a 40' cone fired diagonally</p>

<p>
  But it gets weirder, what if instead of firing the cone diagonally, you fire it forward? Well, then it looks like
  this. Below are
  two overlapping cones, one fired diagonally, one fired forward. As you can see, both are 12 squares long both
  diagonally and
  forward.
</p>

<p>
  What's really weird about this is that you end up with different <em>shapes</em>. One is a triangle, the other is a
  square. The spell shape
  changes based on the direction you fire it. That can't be right, can it?
</p>

<p>
  No, it's not. And that's good, because we haven't been doing it that way, or at least not consistently.ðŸ™‚
</p>

<p>
  But now, man, I'm about to blow your mind. Because here's the thing. Not only are spells not measured
  so that diagonals are always 5 feet, but 
  <em>neither is character movement!</em> "But wait!" I hear you say. "The removed the rule about counting double on
  each square
  when moving diagonally!" Yeah, they did. Because they <em>removed grid combat!!!</em> The only
  mention of grid combat in the PHB is as a variant rule.
</p>

<p style="background-color:antiquewhite">
  <strong>VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID</strong>

  If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules. <br /><br />

  <em>Squares</em> Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.<br /><br />


  <em>Speed</em> Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in
  5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For
  example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.
  <br /><br />

  <em>Entering a Square.</em> To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is
  diagonally adjacent to the square youâ€™re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth
  play. The Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)

</p>

<p>
  As you can see, this is incredibly vaguely worded. It doesn't say "each square is 5', even diagonals.
  It says <em>if</em> you decide to use a grid you <em>could</em> translate your movement into squares
  and always move 5'. Now, you could totally do each one diagonal. It's not against the rules. But these are barely
  rules!
  They just read like suggestions with "ifs" and "coulds" everywhere. It's just a one paragraph <em>suggestion</em>
  about how movement <em>could</em> be. And, most importantly for us, it certainly doesn't say anything about
  <em>spells</em> treating
  each square as 5'. This paragraph is just about movement.
</p>

<p>But it says there are more realistic rules in the DMG there at the end. Let's see what the DMG says </p>

<p style="background-color:antiquewhite">
    <strong>Optional Rule: Diagonals</strong>
  
    The Playerâ€™s Handbook presents a simple method for counting movement and measuring range on a grid: count every square as 5 feet, even if youâ€™re moving diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This optional rule provides more realism, but it requires more effort during combat.
    <br/></br>
    When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever youâ€™re counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For example, a character might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement of 30 feet.he Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)
</p>

<p>So there is no actual "basic" D&D rule about movement on diagonals. One is a "variant" rule in the PHB, one is an "optional"
  rule in the DMG (exactly what the difference is between and optional and variant rule is an exercise left to the reader). 
  Neither is "more" standard than the other, because the standard rule for movement and distance measuring is pure theater of the mind.
</p>

<p>Also for what it's worth, Xanthar's recommends you just use spell templates and forget about that stuff. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>
  So! Sorry if you sat through the whole thing. Let me do the whole "sum up my points" at the end.

  <ul>
    <li>We haven't been doing diagonals count as 5' for all spell shapes before, because we've been using templates for cones
    </li>
    <li>And that's good, because that's the way it should be done. Otherwise most spells would be cubes, or be shaped
      differently depending on which way it was pointing ðŸ˜µ.</li>
    <li>And the diagonal movement rule is bullshit anyway. The PHB has almost nothing to say about
      how to handle map movement, just some loose suggestions as a variant rule, and the DMG is a bit more
      concrete where <em>it</em> tells you to count every other square as 10'.
    </li>
  </ul>
