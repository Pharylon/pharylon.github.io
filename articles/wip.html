<h2>WIP Update</h2>

<p>
  Man, I haven't really done anything around here, have I? *blows dust off the repro*. Huh. Well, let's do some updates.
  First, about the blog itself, I'll probably do push notifications at some point. But not right now, because I don't know
  how much it'd really get used. And I'll probably not ever do comments, because that would be a headache. I don't want to 
  moderate that crap.

  So, uh, we'll just see how it goes. In the meantime, I'm going to start updating this thing more for my own personal use. ðŸ™‚
