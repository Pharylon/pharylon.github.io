<h2>Mobile View (and coming soon: notifications!)</h2>

  I've decided what I want to do is create an alternative to Facebook to find stuff about me. So I know what I need to do to get a minimum viable blog, at least from my persective.
  <ul>
    <li>I need this site to look good on mobile (now done)</li>
    <li>I need comments</li>
    <li>I need push notifications.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Once those are in place, I can start including a link to the blog in my Facebook posts, and maybe phase the site out altogether eventually.</p>

<p>Up next... push notifications!</p>
