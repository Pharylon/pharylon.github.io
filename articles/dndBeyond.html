<h2>D&D Beyond</h2>

<p>Allow me to brag about a little bit of hacking I did recently.</p>

<p>
    D&D Beyond is the "official toolset" of Wizards of the Coast. They're the only place you can go online to 
    officially build a character for Dungeons and Dragons. They also have a phone app, where you can download 
    rulebooks and look stuff up.

    A little over 90 days ago (ðŸ˜‰) I was messing around with the app, and watching what kind of requests 
    it was making to their server, and I noticed that when you add a book through the app, it downloads a really 
    big file full of art and whatnot. When I downloaded it on my PC, I realized the file contained a SQLite db 
    file. I tried to open it, but it was encrypted. However, I also noticed that one of the other API calls the 
    app made was to a "get-book-codes" endpoint, and the reply was a JSON object that looked something like this:

    <p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          <pre>
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": [
        {
            "sourceID": 1,
            "data": "cHVycGxlX211c3RhbmdfY2hhaXJfd2hhdGV2ZXI="
    ]
}
          </pre>
          </code>
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      I looked at that and thought, huh, is that just a Base64 encoded string? Turns out, that's exaclty what it was, and when
      decoded, it was <em>clearly</em> a password. It looked like a few English words picked at random (like, say, sky_chair_varmint_whatever_). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Is that just the SQLLite database password? Sure is! And they used the SQL Cipher 3 default settings! So now I have all the D&D 
        book database files from D&D Beyond. Not that I'll ever really need them or want them for anything! ðŸ˜†
