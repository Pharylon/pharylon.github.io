<h2>I Made A Blog!</h2>
<div class="date">Nov 13, 2018</div>

<p>
    As the title says I made a blog. But, like, I literally made a blog. 
    I went down into the mines with my pickaxe and unearthed fresh, raw bloganium. 
    I took it home and refined it, then worked it into the glorious beast now taking up pixels on your screen.
    This is the story of how I did it.
</p>

<p>
    Hi! I'm Zachary Shuford, and on the Internets I go by the name "Pharylon." So today I decided to make a blog.
    I knew I wanted to use a static site and just throw it up on Github or wherever, but I have zero experience with 
    static site generators. But I keep reading about something called "Jekyll" on Hacker News, 
    so I figured maybe I should give that a whirl. <b>*reads the Jekyll docs*</b> No thanks!
</p>

<p>
    OK, why not Jekyll? First, it's Ruby, which I have zero experience with, and while I 
    probably don't need to grok Ruby to use it, I'm a freakin' web developer. I should know how my tools work. And I'm done
    with learning new technologies this year! I want to actually leverage what I know for once instead of chasing something new and shiny! <span class="emoji">ðŸŒŸ</span>
</p>

<p>
    So I googled around a bit for some other static site generators. There are plenty. But then a little inner voice inside me spoke up.
    "Hey," it said, "you want to build a static site, right? Why do you need a static site <em>generator?</em> Why not just a 
    static site? Let's blog like it's 1999, baby!"
</p>

<p>
    Good point, inner voice. Good point. So I decided to throw something together. Something I could host on Geocities <span class="tiny">Geocities is still a thing, right?</span>
    At first I was resigned with manually making links and curating separate pages. Like, the menu would be on the main page and the articles would be in an iframe or something, right? 
    But the more I messed around with it, the more I realized I could get a lot done with plain ol' javascript! 
</p>

<p>
    And an idea began to form. What if I could build a static blog framework without any "generator." Like, it generates itself in real time using javascript? Has someone
    done this before? Probably, but I didn't see it in my five seconds of googling, and lately I've been trying to give myself permission to do things
    other people have already done. Plus, I could blog about the thing I'm working on <em>on the blog I'm building</em>. It's Blog-ception over here!
</p>

<p>
    So this is the basic thing! Version v0.1-rc-beta-alpha-1! I'm going to add add more stuff to this over time. Tags, RSS, automatic article dating (maybe), and other stuff I'm 
    not currently thinking of. But hey, that'll be the fun part. If you want to follow along, well, the repo is <a href="http://pharylon.github.io/">here</a>, and this
    will be the first commit!
