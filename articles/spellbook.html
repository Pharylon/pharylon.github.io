  I've got a new little side-project. Introducing the <a href ="https://zachshuford.com/Spellbook/">D&D Beyond Spellbook</a>! I literally just built this
  for myself for use in my D&D games. I like D&D Beyond, but the phone app doesn't include custom spells you create on the site. Plus, I'm old-school
  and like to actually have stuff printed out. And that's what this site does. Put your character ID in, get a list of nicely formatted spells out. I do it
  by calling their completely non-public API. The site is really ugly, but get over it. ðŸ˜‰
