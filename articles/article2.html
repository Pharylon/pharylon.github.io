<p>
    I want a second article for my blog, so I'm gonna put this up too. It's a collection of funny things my kids have said.
</p>

<p>
    On the way to preschool, Rosalind saw a garbage truck go by.<br/>
    <b>Rosalind</b>: Where does the trash go?<br/>            
    <b>Artemis</b>: I think it goes on the world.<br/>            
    <b>Rosalind</b>: On the world?<br/>            
    <b>Artemis</b>: Yeah, I think it goes on the world, because I saw trash on the world.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Rosalind</b> walks into the room with a bottle of liquid soap and a washcloth crying. "I can't clean up my accident!" <br/>
    <b>Me</b>: "What accident?"<br/>        
    <b>Rosalind</b>: "I drew on the coffee table!"<br/>        
    <b>Me</b>: "By accident?"<br/>        
    <b>Rosalind</b>: "Yeah."<br/>        
    <b>Me</b>: ðŸ˜’
</p>


<p>
    After making Rosalind help me clean up where she had drawn on the wall...
    <b>Me:</b> "Did you draw anywhere else?"<br/>
    <b>Rosalind</b> turns her head and looks out the door, down the hallway. She says nothing as she thinks long and hard for about ten seconds, then looks back at me.<br/>        
    <b>Rosalind</b>: "No."<br/>
    Upon further investigation, this turned out to have been a lie. ðŸ¤”
</p>

<p>
    <b>Artemis</b> brings me a picture of a stick figure. <br>
    <b>Me</b>: who is this? <br>
    <b>Artemis</b>: It's a picture of Mommy! <br>
    <b>Me</b>: Are you going to give it to Mommy? <br>
    <b>Artemis</b>: No, it's for you, so after Mommy dies and you're sad you can look at it and remember her. <br>
    <b>Me</b>: Okaaaaay.
