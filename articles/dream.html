<h2>My Dream</h2>
<div class="date">Oct 6, 2019</div>

<p>
  Last night I dreamed that I submitted a feature request to the React project because I wanted the option 
  to get a directory listing when visiting <span class="code-snippet">http://foo/bar/</span> but there was no <span class="code-snippet">index.html</span>
  in that directory. And then everyone in the comments was making fun of me because that would be a server-side
  issue and React is obviously a front-end framework.
</p>

<p>Man, am I a dork.</p>
