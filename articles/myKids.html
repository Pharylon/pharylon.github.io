<p>
    <div>On the way to preschool, Rosalind saw a garbage truck go by.</div>
    <div><b>Rosalind</b>: Where does the trash go?  </div>    
    <div><b>Artemis</b>: I think it goes on the world.</div>            
    <div><b>Rosalind</b>: On the world?    </div> 
    <div><b>Artemis</b>: Yeah, I think it goes on the world, because I saw trash on the world.</div>
</p>

<p>
    <div><b>Rosalind</b> walks into the room with a bottle of liquid soap and a washcloth crying. "I can't clean up my accident!" </div>
    <div><b>Me</b>: "What accident?"</div>
    <div><b>Rosalind</b>: "I drew on the coffee table!" </div>      
    <div><b>Me</b>: "By accident?"   </div>  
    <div><b>Rosalind</b>: "Yeah."   </div>    
    <div><b>Me</b>: ðŸ˜’</div>
</p>


<p>
    <div>After making Rosalind help me clean up where she had drawn on the wall...</div>
    <div><b>Me:</b> "Did you draw anywhere else?"</div>
    <div><b>Rosalind</b> turns her head and looks out the door, down the hallway. She says nothing as she thinks long and hard for about ten seconds, then looks back at me.      </div> 
    <div><b>Rosalind</b>: "No."</div>
    <div>Upon further investigation, this turned out to have been a lie. ðŸ¤”</div>
</p>

<p>
    <div><b>Artemis</b> brings me a picture of a stick figure. </div>
    <div><b>Me</b>: who is this? </div>
    <div><b>Artemis</b>: It's a picture of Mommy! </div>
    <div><b>Me</b>: Are you going to give it to Mommy? </div>
    <div><b>Artemis</b>: No, it's for you, so after Mommy dies and you're sad you can look at it and remember her. </div>
